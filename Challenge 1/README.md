Specifications

    Please commit your answer to a GitHub repository.
    Retrieve data for 100 random users from only the United States and Germany, and the United Kingdom. Your code should retrieve this data from a single API request. The response format should be in JSON.
    Output the response into a file that should be committed with the rest of your code.
    Using January 1, 1990 as a midpoint, divide and sort the 100 responses into two csv files based on the usersâ€™ birthdates.
    Create one CSV file that contains all American males born after January 1, 1980.
    The output csv files should have descriptive file names and contain column headers.
